.SYNOPSIS
In some environments sysadmins need to deploy VM from templates instead of using classic WDS.
The script has been created to permit Sysadmins to build a new VM from PowerShell instead of vSphere GUI for more efficiency and simplicity.
.DESCRIPTION
The script will build a VM based on the input received by the user of the script.

The workflow is as follow:
**************************
Step 1: Sysadmin connects to a specific vcenter where to build the new VM.
Step 2: Sysadmin will input all the required information to permit the script to build the VM.
Step 3: The script builds the VM and ask the user if he needs additional modifications on the VM (CPU/RAM).
Step 4: The script asks the user if it needs to start the new built VM.
Step 4: The script auto-shutdown

Error handling is managed by to kind of actions:
************************************************

DO... UNTIL (human error)
TRY...CATCH (system & human error)

.INPUTS
As the script is interactive, it requires some input from the user of the script.
The typo errors are suppressed by the Out-gridview command which permits the user to select the data instead of typing it.
Here is the requested input that is mandatory for the script being able to create the VM.

Vcenter FQDN
VMNAME (name of the new VM to build)
VMTEMPLATE (the template that will be used as foundation for the building of the VM)
VMFOLDER
VMDATASTORE ( The datasore VMFS/NFS where will reside the VM)
ESX (The initial ESXi host that will run the VM)
VMINC PG (The port Group associated to VMNIC1 of the VM / Standard of Distributed vSwitch)
GUESTCUSTOMIZATION (Specifies the Guest OS customization template that will be used for launching the sysprep operations)

.OUTPUTS
The script is quite verbose, so the user will receive extensive information
The main output is the following:
Confirmation of the creation of the VM and its' powerstate
